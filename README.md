# Outlook-Work-Schedule
Read the latest mail of work schedule and create a reminder in google calendar 

Hey!
Thanks for trying my software!

This software will create an event/s on your Google calendar based on your work schdule 

How to use it:
  * Prerequisites:
    ** Log in to your work mail on Outlook
    ** Create a rule in your Outlook that will store all the Work Schdule mails in one folder
    ** Open Outlook-Work-Schedule/Configs/user_config.yaml and change what you need (Read the notes)
  
  * Run the program: (CAN'T DO IT RIGHT NOW PLEASE WAIT FOR UPDATE)
    ** Run the Outlook-Work-Schedule/main.exe
    
I'll upload a .docx file for a better guide (with pictures)
